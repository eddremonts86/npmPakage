## ðŸš€ HOW TO TEST

### Start both environments:

**Option 1: Manual start**

cd develoments/css-based
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Tailwind-based (port 5174)
cd develoments/tailwind-based
npm run dev -- --port 5174
```

**Option 2: Automated script**

```bash
# Windows
scripts/test-final-parity.bat

# Linux/Mac
scripts/test-final-parity.sh
```

### Visual Verification Points:

1. **Layout**: Both environments should look identical
2. **Colors**: Same shadcn/ui color scheme in light/dark modes
3. **Dialog**: Should open/close smoothly with proper scroll prevention
4. **Theme Toggle**: Should work in both environments
5. **Components**: Buttons, Cards, Badges should render identically
6. **Interactions**: All user interactions should behave the same
